## Overview

Dropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and actions. They should be used to hide secondary actions a component, and not to capture an option selection in a Form. If you are looking for elements to use within a Form context, please visit the [Selects](/Develop/Components/Selects) documentation.

Dropdowns are activated by clicking. Hover effects should be reserved for providing the user with additional information & links (for example, [Tooltips](/Develop/Components/Tooltips)), as having hover effects on actions often results in users causing them to unintentionally fire.
