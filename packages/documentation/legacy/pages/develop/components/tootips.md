# Overview

Tooltips are an extremely useful way of providing extra contextual information to elements on a page and often appear
as a bubble near an element when the user mouses over it, with a tail to indicate the element it is associated with.

The standards library does not offer a tooltip, instead the user is advised to use the tooltips provided by
[Balloon.css](https://kazzkiq.github.io/balloon.css/). Balloon CSS provides a simple to use Tooltip that can be added
via data attributes on your element.

Tooltips can contain text or emoji but cannot contain HTML markup. For this you will need to use a Popover.
