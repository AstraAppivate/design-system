## Assumptions

This guide assumes that you are familiar with the following technologies:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- Basic terminal commands (Most commonly [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) or [Windows Command Prompt]())

It is worth taking time to familiarise yourself with these technologies, as they serve as the basis of the NELSON toolkit.

It also makes the assumption that you have already set up a basic node project and want to add the component library to it.

## Installation

In your favourite command line tool, navigate to your project's root folder and type one of the following:

### If you are using NPM

```bash
npm install @RoyalNavy/[package name]
```

### If you are using Yarn

```bash
yarn add @RoyalNavy/[package name]
```
