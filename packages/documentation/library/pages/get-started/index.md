# Get started
NELSON Standards have been created with designers and developers in mind. Getting started guides are available for each:

* As a [designer](/get-started/design), use Standards to ideate and iterate your design. The Sketch toolkit provides components and patterns you can use to ensure users have a consistent experience across NELSON Apps.
* As a [developer](/get-started/develop), use Standards libraries to save time and develop applications that are consistent across the Royal Navy. The guide includes installation, usage, recommended technologies and code examples.
