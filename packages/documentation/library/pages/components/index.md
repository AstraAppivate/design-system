# Components
Components are reusable UI elements that form the building blocks of Applications and services. Their design is based on defined NELSON [styles](/styles).

Components can be used in many design patterns and contexts, for example a button could be used to submit information or progress to a subsequent screen.

You can read the '[get started](/get-started)' to find out more about how to use components to design and develop Applications.

The list of components available in NELSON is evolving rapidly, but if you think there is something missing, or have a question please [contact the Standards team](/contact).
