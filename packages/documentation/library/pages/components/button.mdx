The Button Component provides methods for users to take action in an interface. They are placed throughout your UI and often serve as the main action of a component.

![The Button Component](../../images/components/button/component.svg)

## Usage
The usage section is a bullet pointed list of scenarios the component should be used in.

---

# Design
Buttons are available in 3 variants - [Primary](#primary), [Secondary](#secondary), and [Tertiary](#tertiary). These variants allow you to establish [hierarchy](#hierarchy) in your interfaces.

## Anatomy
The Anatomy is the breakdown of the component.

![Button Component anatomy](../../images/components/button/anatomy.svg)

1. **Container**. The container element wraps the component.
2. **Label**. Labels describe the button action to the user. If text is not used, an icon should be used in its place.
3. **Icon** (optional). The button component can optionally have icons placed either to the left or right of the label. No more than 1 icon should be used per button.

## Sizing & Spacing
The Button component has 4 sizes available to use - small, regular, large, and xLarge.
By default, you should use the regular button - this has been designed to fit the majority of UI use cases. For forms, the Large button has been created so it sits at the same height as the [textInput](/components/textInput) component. The small and xLarge buttons are available for specific use cases where the primary/large buttons are unsuitable.

## Hierarchy & Placement
Establishing visual hierarchy in your UI is important as it helps the user understand the main actions of your page or component. The Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary buttons have different application use cases, so be sure to read the following sections to understand where best to use these variations.

---

### Primary Button

![Primary Button](../../images/components/button/primary.svg)

#### Usage
The Primary Button is responsible for the most important action of a particular page.

#### States
Like all variations of the Button component, the Primary Button has 3 states - default, hover, and focus.
![Primary Button States](../../images/components/button/primary-states.svg)

#### Hierarchy & Placement
Try to avoid using multiple Primary Buttons in the same piece of UI - this can confuse the user as to what the main action is. If you need multiple actions, decide which action is the most important/often used and make this your Primary Button. All other actions should take the form of Secondary or Tertiary Buttons.

---

### Secondary Button
![Secondary Button](../../images/components/button/secondary.svg)

#### Usage
The Secondary Button is a supportive action for a Primary Button. Whilst not serving as the main action of a section of UI, their role is to offer additional actions for a user.

#### States
![Secondary Button States](../../images/components/button/secondary-states.svg)

### Hierarchy & Placement
You can use multiple Secondary Buttons in the same section of UI. Their unobtrusive nature allows them to sit out of the main focus for the user, but still be present enough for the user to interact with.

---

### Tertiary Button
The Tertiary Button is a text styled button that has no border or background.
![Tertiary Button](../../images/components/button/tertiary.svg)

#### Usage
Tertiary Buttons are unobtrusive actions that should support Primary or Sectionday Buttons. They should not be the main focus of the UI, but should still be easily discoverable by the user. They are best suited to things like Cancel buttons, where the goal is to allow the user to exit a primary or secondary action decision.

#### States
Like all other buttons, Tertiary Buttons have 3 main interactive states:

#### Hierarchy & Placement
Try to avoid using multiple Tertiary Buttons next to each other. Their supportive role is best used to undo a Primary or Secondary action.
