# Overview

A toggle is a simple component that acts like a switch, with a on or of state. When used in a HTML form a toggle stores its value using a hidden checkbox field.

## Usage

The toggle component can be used as a Vue/React component anywhere in a page or within an HTML form.

### HTML

When used in a regular web page the toggle component uses markup identical to a checkbox but with classes to indicate the component should be progressivey enhanced to appear like a toggle.
