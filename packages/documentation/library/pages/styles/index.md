# Styles
Styles are used to make your Application or service match the NELSON Standards look-and-feel. They form the foundation of the design for all [components](/components) and patterns.

The styling specification includes elements such as [colour](/styles/colour), [typography](/styles/typography) and [spacing](/styles/spacing). If you need to create a new component or pattern you should ensure that it complies with NELSON styling guidelines.

NELSON styles should be used to fill in the gaps around existing components and patterns. For example you should apply the spacing rules to each element that you add to a design.
