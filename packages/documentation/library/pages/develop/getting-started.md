The Nelson toolkit provides a suite of components and CSS styles which you can use to build your webapp. 

## Assumptions

This guide makes the following assumptions:

- You have basic knowledge of HTML
- You have basic knowledge of CSS
- You are comfortable working with SASS

## Components

The toolkit includes components to help build up a page with minimal coding, this guide contains HTML snippets which you can copy and paste directly into your HTML page and use immediately.

[A full list of those components is available here](/develop/).

## Installation

In order to use the HTML snippets you will first need to add the toolkit css to your HTML file.

To do this locate the `<head>` section and add the following snippet:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

Then you are good to go.

## Layouts

If you are planning on only using the toolkit to build a page, you will need to use a layout component. To do this, simply add the following immediately after the opening `<body>` tag:

```html
<div class="rn-layout">
  <-- Your content goes here -->
</div>
```
<!-- ED: You need to update this bit, I pulled the above code out of the air -->

## Use with front-end frameworks.

These components and classes can be used in any package but obviously if you are using a front-end framework like React or Vue then the component HTML may need to be altered to accomodate this, unfortunately that is out of the scope of this document but we do have a React and Vue version of this component library coming soon. Keep an eye on this website for more information.

## If something isn't working.
