# Design Tokens
An agnostic way to store variables such as typography, color, and spacing.

## Installation
The Royal Navy Design Tokens are available as a NPM package.

```
// npm
npm install @royalnavy/design-tokens

// yarn
yarn add @royalnavy/design-tokens
```

If you want to install the prerelease then use the `@next` distribution tag.

## Usage - SASS
```css
@use '@royalnavy/design-tokens' as $vars
```
NOTE: Application developers should consider consuming the @royalnavy/css-framework package instead of this package.

## Usage - Styled Components
```javascript
import { selectors } from "@royalnavy/design-tokens";

const { color, spacing } = selectors

// inside a styled-component
const StyledExample = styled.div`
  color: ${color('action', '500')};
  margin-top: ${spacing('2')};
`;
```
