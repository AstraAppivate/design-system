# Overview

Cards are flexible content containers, adding visual grouping to sub components.

```html
  <div class="rn-card">
      Card Content
  </div>
```

# Card Body

The Card Body provides a padded section to place your content inside of. The Card component can accept multiple Card Body components - these are visually divided with a border between each body section.

```html
  <div class="rn-card">
    <div class="rn-card__body">
      A Card with Body Content
    </div>
  </div>
```

# Card Header

Add an optional Header within a card.

```html
  <div class="rn-card">
    <div class="rn-card__header">
      Card Header
    </div>
    <div class="rn-card__body">
      A Card with Body Content
    </div>
  </div>
```
